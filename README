Experimental release of luatexjit , i.e. LuaTeX + LuaJIT.
It uses  luatex rev. 4486  and luajit 2.0
previously configured for TARGET_X86 
(currently it *doesn't work* on x86_64)

Cross-compilation for Windows and MacOSX are not enabled.

To build the  luatexjit executable:
$>./build-jit.sh

If all is ok it finishes with  the message
-rwxrwxrwx 1 foo foo 5759756 nov 21 16:02 build/texk/web2c/luatexjit

You need also jit.zip and must be unzipped into a folder 
reachable by luatexjit.

NOTE:
it's possible to use luatexjit with ConTeXt mkiv
(http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Main_Page)
but keep in mind that:

1) lua and luajit have different command line options
and mkiv uses lua to   manage files. So it's very likely that some 
lua files of the distro must be modified to match luajit.


2) even if mkiv is still under active development, 
some parts are already optimized, and, in any case, the hard work is done by the core tex, where
luajit has no effect. So it's likely that  on average there will be only small improvements in speed
and more or less the memory usage  will be  the same .
